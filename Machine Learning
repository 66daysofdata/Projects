# Machine Learning Projects

## For Beginners

This list is curated to learn ML by making projects on Regression, Classification and Clustering based algorithms.

1. **Cartoonify Image with Machine Learning**

      **Project Idea**: Transform images into its cartoon. Yes, the objective of this machine learning project is to cartoonify the images.  Thus, we will build a python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using machine learning libraries.

2. **Iris Flowers Classification**

     **Project idea**: This is a beginner friendly project with a very easy dataset to work on. The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals.  A basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower.

3. **Loan Prediction**

      **Project idea**:  The idea behind this ML project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take.  It is based on the userâ€™s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. We can build a linear model for this project.

4. **Housing Prices Prediction**:

      **Project Idea**:  The dataset has house prices of the Boston residential areas.  The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc... It is a good ML project for beginners to predict prices on the basis of new data.

5. **Titanic Survival**

      **Project idea**:  This will be a fun project to build as we will be predicting whether someone would have survived if they were in the titanic ship or not. For this beginnerâ€™s project.  We will use the Titanic dataset that contains real data of the survivors and people who died in the Titanic ship.

6. **Wine Quality Test**

    **Project idea**: In this project, we can build an interface to predict the quality of the red wine. It will use the chemical information of the wine and based on the machine learning model.  It will give us the result of wine quality.

7. **Fake News Detection**

    **Project Idea**:  Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era. We can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. We can use supervised learning to implement a model like this.

## Intermediate
1. **Music Genre Classification**

   **Project Idea**:
   The idea behind this python machine learning project is to develop a machine learning project and automatically classify different musical genres from audio.  We need to classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.

2. **Bitcoin Price Predictor**

    **Project idea**: The bitcoin price predictor is a useful project. The blockchain technology is increasing and there are many digital currencies rising. 
    This project will help you predict the price of the bitcoin using previous data.

3. **Uber Data Analysis**

    **Project idea**: The project can be used to perform data visualization on the uber data. The dataset contains 4.5 millions of uber pickups in the new york city. 
    This much data needs to be represented beautifully in order to analyze the rides so that further improvements in the business can be made.

4. **Personality Prediction**

    **Project idea**: The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a personality type system that divides a person into 16 distinct personalities based on introversion, intuition, 
    thinking and perceiving capabilities. We can identify the personality of a person from the type of posts they put on social media.<br>

## Advanced
1. **Xbox Game Prediction**

     **Project idea**: The data generated by people while searching can be used to predict the interest of the users. The BestBuy consumer electronics company has provided the data of millions of searches from users and we will predict the Xbox game that a user will be most interested to buy. This will be used to recommend games to the visitors.  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/acm-sf-chapter-hackathon-small/overview">Dataset</a>

2. **Enron Investigation**

     **Project idea**: The Enron company collapsed in 2000 but the data was made available for investigation. The database has 500,000 emails of real employees who worked in the company so the data is very useful to perform data analytics and many data scientist use this dataset.  <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/">Dataset</a>
